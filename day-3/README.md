# Day 3: Advanced Workflows & Reality Check

## Overview
Learn multi-step workflows, realistic expectations about AI capabilities, and advanced verification strategies.

## Materials

### Presentation
- [**Day 3 Slides**](day3-slides.html) - Main presentation deck (28 slides)
- [**Presenter Notes**](presenter-notes-day3.md) - Detailed teaching guide with timing
- [**Demo Materials**](demo-materials-day3.md) - Copy-paste prompts and examples
- [**Demo Screenshots**](demo-screenshots.html) - Interactive copy-paste interface
- [**Slide Notes**](day3-slide-notes.md) - Quick reference talking points

## Quick Start
1. Open the [Day 3 Slides](day3-slides.html)
2. Complete the workflow-building exercise
3. Share your multi-step workflow in the Prompt Library

## Learning Objectives
- Build multi-step workflows by chaining prompts
- Know when to use search, code interpreter, and thinking models
- Understand realistic AI timelines and capabilities
- Implement verification strategies to catch hallucinations
- Create reusable templates from successful outputs
- Navigate privacy and data security considerations

## Key Concepts
- **The Decade of Agents:** Realistic timeline expectations (Karpathy insight)
- **Chaining Prompts:** Break complex tasks into simple steps
- **LLM Council:** Compare outputs from multiple AIs
- **Two-Step Verification:** Transcribe → Verify → Analyze
- **Tool Selection:** Decision tree for choosing the right tool
- **Safe Prompting:** Add verification requirements to prompts

## Session Structure (60 minutes)
- **0-5 min:** Welcome & Recap Days 1-2
- **5-21 min:** Reality check + Tool selection
- **21-31 min:** **Live Demo: Multi-step workflow**
- **31-55 min:** Advanced concepts (verification, privacy, thinking models)
- **55-67 min:** **Exercise: Build your workflow**
- **67-87 min:** Pitfalls, Q&A, Wrap-up

## Homework
- Build one multi-step workflow (3+ chained prompts) for a recurring task
- Test the LLM Council approach on an important decision
- Create a reusable template from your best workflow
- Share your workflow in the team Prompt Library
- Practice verification strategies on all critical outputs

## What You'll Learn
