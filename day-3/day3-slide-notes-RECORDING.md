## Opening (Before Slide 1)
Welcome to Day 3—the final session.
Today is advanced workflows, reality checks,
and your complete AI toolkit. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 1 — Title
Welcome to Day 3.
Advanced workflows, reality checks,
and your AI toolkit—all together. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 2 — Quick Recap: Days 1 & 2
Day 1: prompting basics.
Day 2: tools and projects.
Today: advanced workflows and realistic expectations. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 3 — Today's Focus
We’ll cover multi‑step workflows,
when to add tools,
agent reality,
saving what works,
and verification strategies. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 4 — Reality Check: The Decade of Agents
Hype says AI replaces all jobs this year.
Reality: it’ll take about a decade.

What AI can do today:
draft docs, summarize, answer questions,
help with code, generate images.

What’s missing:
continual learning, true multimodal understanding,
full computer use, human‑level judgment,
reliable execution.

Key message: AI is a powerful assistant—
it makes you faster. [pause]

## Slide 5 — When to Add Tools to Your AI
By default, AI is a “zip file”—
no internet, no calculator.

Use Web Search for recent info and fact‑checking.
Use Code Interpreter for math, data analysis, charts,
and spreadsheets.
Use Thinking Models for complex reasoning
or when the first answer fails.

Decision tree: start simple.
If it’s wrong or outdated, add tools.
Still wrong? Try a thinking model. [pause]

---

## Slide 6 — Multi-Document Workflow
Real example: compare five quarterly reports
in one Claude Project.

Steps: create project, upload all reports,
compare metrics, create a table,
turn it into an email summary.

Why it works: docs in working memory;
AI can cross‑reference; no manual comparison.
Always spot‑check numbers. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 7 — Chaining Prompts: Build Complex Outputs
Break big tasks into small steps.
Example: podcast → five key points →
expand one into a blog → five tweets → email intro.

Each step builds on the last.
That’s far better than one giant prompt. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 8 — Live Demo: Multi-Step Workflow
Task: turn one document into multiple outputs—
summary, email, social posts.
Watch the whole workflow step by step. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 9 — When You MUST Use Search Tools
Without search, AI will make stuff up.
Its knowledge is 6+ months old.

Use search for news, launches, prices,
company info, and recent research.
Skip search for general knowledge, writing,
brainstorming, and documents you upload.
When in doubt, search. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 10 — Spreadsheet & Data Workflows
Upload CSV or Excel to Claude.
Ask for top trends, pivot tables,
and rows above thresholds.

Always verify numbers.
Better yet—have AI write formulas
you can check. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 11 — Image Understanding: The Two-Step Rule
Critical rule: Transcribe → Verify → Analyze.
Bad: upload blood test → “Is this healthy?”
Good: transcribe values to a table, verify,
then analyze.
Misreads can be dangerous—verify first. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 12 — Hallucinations: How to Catch Them
AI prefers to answer—even when unsure.

Catch issues by asking for sources,
cross‑checking with Google,
using search tools,
asking “How confident? What could be wrong?”,
and comparing two AIs.

Prevent by adding:
“Only use info I provided,”
“If unsure, say so,”
upload source docs,
and always verify critical info.

Rule: important → verify; critical → verify twice;
life, death, or legal → don’t rely on AI alone. [pause]

---

## Slide 13 — Privacy & Data Security
On free/plus tiers, what you paste can be used for training
unless you opt out.

Safe: public info, your non‑confidential writing,
public docs, general questions.
Don’t share: customer data, internal financials,
proprietary strategies, confidential docs, passwords.

Enterprise tiers have privacy guarantees—
check with IT. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 14 — Thinking Models: When to Use Them
Thinking models “think” before answering.
Best for complex math, multi‑step reasoning,
debugging code, logic puzzles,
or when the first answer fails.

Not needed for simple questions,
writing, summarizing, brainstorming,
or quick lookups.

Available: o4‑mini, Claude Sonnet 4.5 Extended,
DeepSeek R1, Grok 3 Deep Search.
Trade‑off: 30 seconds to 2 minutes—
worth it for hard problems. [pause]

## Slide 15 — Save What Works: Build Your Template Library
One great output can become a reusable template.
Reverse‑engineering trick:
paste the perfect result and ask for the prompt
that would reliably recreate it.

Where to save: notes, Custom GPTs,
Claude Projects with instructions.
Test three times, refine, add examples. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 16 — Coding Agents: The Reality
Three levels:
Autocomplete (Cursor/Copilot),
Vibe Coding (Claude/ChatGPT),
and Fully Autonomous (not production‑ready).

Great for boilerplate, common patterns,
learning a language, and prototypes.
Struggle with novel code, custom architectures,
security, and complex debugging.
Bottom line: amazing assistants—
human oversight required. [pause]

[switch slide]

## Slide 17 — Live Demo: Advanced Multi-Step Workflow
Demo: long article → summary + email + social posts + key quotes
using a Claude Project and chained prompts.
Notice how each step builds on the last. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 18 — Decision Tree: Which Tool When?
Step 1: need recent info? → Use Search.
Step 2: need numbers/data? → Code Interpreter.
Step 3: hard reasoning/coding? → Thinking Model.
Step 4: reuse context 3+ times? → Project.

Start simple. Add tools only when needed. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 19 — Verification Checklist: Catch Errors Early
Before you trust an output, verify:
numbers, facts, sources, logic,
transcription accuracy, and consistency across AIs.

Prompt add‑on: “Show your work.
Explain your reasoning.
Flag assumptions.” [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 20 — What's Coming Next (2025-2026)
Likely soon (6–12 months):
better long‑term memory,
more reliable coding agents,
improved video generation,
better integrations,
lower costs.

Still years away:
fully autonomous agents with zero errors,
true continual learning,
replacing human judgment,
perfect reliability,
AGI.

“It’s the decade of agents, not the year.” [pause]

## Slide 21 — Your AI Toolkit: What to Use When
Here’s your toolkit—bookmark it.
Pick two or three tools you’ll use most.
Don’t try to master everything—
focus on what helps your work. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 22 — Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them
Six mistakes and fixes:
trusting without verifying,
one giant prompt,
wrong tool for the job,
forgetting to iterate,
sharing sensitive data,
not saving what works. [pause]
