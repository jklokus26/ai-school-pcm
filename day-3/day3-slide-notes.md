# Day 3: Presenter Notes

**Format:** What to SAY and DO for each slide. Scan quickly while presenting.

---

## Slide 1 — Title
**SAY:** "Welcome to Day 3! Today: advanced workflows, reality checks, and your complete AI toolkit."

**DO:** Set tone for final, most advanced day.

---

## Slide 2 — Quick Recap: Days 1 & 2
**SAY:** "Day 1: Prompting basics. Day 2: Core tools and projects. Today: Advanced workflows and realistic expectations."

**DO:** Point to the three boxes.

---

## Slide 3 — Today's Focus
**SAY:** "Today covers: multi-step workflows, when to add tools, agent reality check, save what works, verification strategies."

**ASK:** "Ready to become an AI power user?"

---

## Slide 4 — Reality Check: The Decade of Agents
**SAY:** "Hype says AI replaces all jobs this year. Reality: it's going to take about a decade."

**SAY:** "AI CAN do today: draft docs, summarize, answer questions, help with code, generate images."

**SAY:** "Still MISSING: continual learning, true multimodal understanding, full computer use, human-level judgment, reliable execution."

**KEY MESSAGE:** "AI is a powerful assistant TODAY—not replacing your job, making you faster."

---

## Slide 5 — When to Add Tools to Your AI
**SAY:** "Remember: by default, AI is just a 'zip file'—no internet, no calculator."

**SAY:** "Web Search for: recent info, current events, product comparisons, fact-checking."

**SAY:** "Code Interpreter for: math, data analysis, charts, processing spreadsheets."

**SAY:** "Thinking Models for: complex reasoning, hard math/code, when first answer fails."

**DECISION TREE:** "Start simple. If answer is wrong/outdated, add tools. If still wrong, try thinking model."

---

## Slide 6 — Multi-Document Workflow
**SAY:** "Real workflow example: comparing 5 quarterly reports in one Claude Project."

**SAY:** "Five steps: Create project, upload all reports, compare metrics, create table, turn into email summary."

**WHY IT WORKS:** "All docs in working memory, AI can cross-reference, no manual comparison."

**WARNING:** "Verify numbers are accurate. Always spot-check critical data."

---

## Slide 7 — Chaining Prompts: Build Complex Outputs
**SAY:** "Pro technique: Break big tasks into small steps."

**EXAMPLE:** "Podcast → 5 key points → expand one into blog post → turn into 5 tweets → create email intro."

**KEY INSIGHT:** "Each prompt builds on the last. AI keeps context. Way more powerful than one giant prompt!"

---

## Slide 8 — Live Demo: Multi-Step Workflow
**SAY:** "Task: Turn a document into multiple outputs—summary, email, social posts."

**DO:** Run live demo. Open demo-screenshots.html for materials.

---

## Slide 9 — When You MUST Use Search Tools
**SAY:** "Without search, AI will make stuff up! Its knowledge is 6+ months old."

**USE SEARCH FOR:** "News, current events, product launches, stock prices, company info, recent research."

**SKIP SEARCH FOR:** "General knowledge, historical facts, writing tasks, brainstorming, docs you upload."

**PRO TIP:** "In ChatGPT, click 'Search' button. In Perplexity, it searches automatically. When in doubt, search!"

---

## Slide 10 — Spreadsheet & Data Workflows
**SAY:** "Upload CSV/Excel to Claude. Ask: 'Summarize data, what are top 3 trends?' Create pivot tables. List rows above threshold."

**WARNING:** "ALWAYS verify numbers! AI might say $1.2M when spreadsheet shows $1.02M."

**BETTER APPROACH:** "Have AI write formulas you can verify, not just give answers."

---

## Slide 11 — Image Understanding: The Two-Step Rule
**SAY:** "Critical rule: Transcribe → Verify → Analyze."

**BAD EXAMPLE:** "Upload blood test → 'Are my results healthy?' AI might misread values."

**GOOD EXAMPLE:** "Upload → transcribe all values to table → verify numbers match → NOW analyze."

**REAL RISK:** "AI misreading '100' as '1000' in medical results could lead to wrong conclusions."

---

## Slide 12 — Hallucinations: How to Catch Them
**SAY:** "AI is trained to always give an answer—even when it doesn't know. Would rather make something up than say 'I don't know.'"

**HOW TO CATCH:** "Ask for sources, cross-check with Google, use search tools, ask 'How confident? What could be wrong?', compare outputs from 2 AIs."

**PREVENTION:** "Add to prompts: 'Only use info I provided,' 'If unsure, say I don't have enough information,' upload source docs, verify critical info always."

**RULE:** "If important, verify it. If critical, verify twice. If life/death or legal, don't rely on AI alone."

---

## Slide 13 — Privacy & Data Security
**SAY:** "What you paste can be used for training on free/plus tiers—unless you opt out."

**SAFE TO SHARE:** "Public info, your own non-confidential writing, public docs, general questions."

**DON'T SHARE:** "Customer data, internal financials, proprietary strategies, confidential docs, passwords."

**PRO TIP:** "ChatGPT Enterprise and Claude for Work have privacy guarantees. Ask your IT team."

---

## Slide 14 — Thinking Models: When to Use Them
**SAY:** "Thinking models 'think' before answering—trained to reason step-by-step."

**BEST FOR:** "Complex math, multi-step reasoning, debugging code, logic puzzles, when first answer is wrong."

**NOT NEEDED FOR:** "Simple questions, writing, summarizing, brainstorming, quick lookups."

**AVAILABLE:** "o4-mini (ChatGPT), Claude Sonnet 4.5 Extended, DeepSeek R1 (Perplexity), Grok 3 Deep Search."

**TRADE-OFF:** "Takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Worth it for hard problems, overkill for simple tasks."

---

## Slide 15 — Save What Works: Build Your Template Library
**SAY:** "One great output → reusable template forever."

**REVERSE-ENGINEERING TECHNIQUE:** "Paste your perfect output, ask: 'Give me the exact prompt that would produce this format and quality every time.'"

**WHERE TO SAVE:** "Personal notes, Custom GPTs, Claude Projects with instructions, notes doc."

**KEEP ITERATING:** "Test template 3 times, refine what doesn't work, add examples for consistency."

---

## Slide 16 — Coding Agents: The Reality
**SAY:** "Three levels: Autocomplete (Cursor/Copilot for experienced coders), Vibe Coding (Claude/ChatGPT for boilerplate), Fully Autonomous (still not production-ready)."

**WORK WELL FOR:** "Boilerplate code, common patterns, languages you're learning, non-critical prototypes."

**STRUGGLE WITH:** "Novel code, custom architectures, production security, complex debugging."

**BOTTOM LINE:** "AI coding tools are amazing assistants. Not replacing engineers yet. Human oversight essential."

---

## Slide 17 — Live Demo: Advanced Multi-Step Workflow
**SAY:** "Demo: Long article → Summary + Email + Social posts + Key quotes using Claude Project + chained prompts."

**DO:** Run live demo. Open demo-screenshots.html.

**POINT OUT:** "Each step builds on the last. This saves hours of manual work."

---

## Slide 18 — Decision Tree: Which Tool When?
**SAY:** "Walk through the decision tree step by step."

**STEP 1:** "Need recent info (last 6 months)? → Yes: Use Search Tool. No: Continue."

**STEP 2:** "Need to process numbers/data? → Yes: Use Code Interpreter. No: Continue."

**STEP 3:** "Hard reasoning/coding problem? → Yes: Try Thinking Model. No: Use standard model."

**STEP 4:** "Reuse context 3+ times? → Yes: Create Project. No: Just use regular chat."

**REMEMBER:** "Start simple. Add tools only when needed. More tools ≠ better results."

---

## Slide 19 — Verification Checklist: Catch Errors Early
**SAY:** "Before trusting AI output, verify these six things:"

**CHECKLIST:** "Numbers (spot-check calculations), Facts (verify with Google), Sources (check they're real), Logic (does reasoning make sense?), Transcription (if from image, verify text matches), Consistency (compare with another AI)."

**PRO TIP:** "Add to prompts: 'Show your work. Explain your reasoning. Flag any assumptions.'"

---

## Slide 20 — What's Coming Next (2025-2026)
**SAY:** "Likely soon (6-12 months): Better long-term memory, more reliable coding agents, improved video generation, better integration, lower costs."

**STILL YEARS AWAY:** "Fully autonomous agents with zero errors, true continual learning, replacing human judgment, perfect reliability, AGI."

**TIMELINE:** "'It's the decade of agents, not the year'—Andrej Karpathy."

**DO:** Point to video placeholder if time allows.

---

## Slide 21 — Your AI Toolkit: What to Use When
**SAY:** "Your complete toolkit—bookmark this slide as your reference."

**DO:** Scan table row by row, highlighting key recommendations.

**PRO TIP:** "Bookmark 2-3 tools you use most. Don't master everything—focus on what helps YOUR work."

---

## Slide 22 — Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them
**SAY:** "Six common mistakes and fixes:"

**#1:** "Trusting without verifying → Fix: Always verify critical info, add 'cite sources.'"

**#2:** "One giant prompt → Fix: Chain small prompts, each builds on last."

**#3:** "Wrong tool for job → Fix: Match tool to task (see decision tree)."

**#4:** "Forgetting to iterate → Fix: 'Make it shorter/longer/more specific.'"

**#5:** "Sharing sensitive data → Fix: Check policy, use Enterprise tier."

**#6:** "Not saving what works → Fix: Save prompts as templates or Custom GPTs."

---

## Slide 23 — Safe Prompting Checklist
**SAY:** "Add these safety phrases to your prompts to prevent errors."

**DO:** Read through the 5 bullet points.

**EXAMPLE:** "Show the complete safe prompt example at bottom of slide."

---

## Slide 24 — Q&A & Discussion
**SAY:** "Your turn! Questions about advanced workflows? Verification strategies? Privacy concerns?"

**ASK:** "What workflow will you try? What clicked for you? How will this change your work?"

**KEY MESSAGE:** "Save your best workflows somewhere convenient!"

---
