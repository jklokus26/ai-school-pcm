**Steps:**
1. Start Zoom meeting (doesn't need participants)
2. Share Screen → select your browser window
3. Click Record → "Record to this Computer"
4. After session ends, Zoom auto-saves to `~/Documents/Zoom/`
5. Upload to Google Drive and share link

### **Option 2: Loom**

### **Recording Best Practices:**
✅ Announce at start: "Recording for teammates who can't join!"  
✅ Speak 10-15% slower than normal (clarity)  
✅ If you mess up, pause and restart that sentence  
✅ Test audio beforehand (speak from where you'll present)

## **💡 Teaching Philosophy (From World's Best Educators)**

### **Active Learning (John Hattie)**
Research shows: Students learn best by DOING, not listening.
- **Your application:** 70% of time is hands-on practice

### **Growth Mindset (Carol Dweck)**
Celebrate effort and iteration, not perfection.
- **Your application:** "Great refinement!" vs "That's perfect!"

### **Scaffolding (Lev Vygotsky)**
Provide just enough support, then let them try.
- **Your application:** Demo once, they practice immediately

### **Relevance (Simon Sinek - Start With Why)**
Show the "why" before the "how."
- **Your application:** Lead with time saved, not features

---

## **🆘 Troubleshooting**

### **"The slides won't open"**
- Right-click `day1-slides.html` → Open With → Chrome or Safari
- If still stuck, open your browser first, then drag the file into the browser window

### **"AI is responding slowly during demo"**
- Have backup screenshots of expected outputs ready
- Say: "Perfect example of why we iterate and stay flexible!"

### **"Someone asks a question I don't know"**
- "Great question—let me test that and follow up after the session"
- Or: "Who here has experience with that? [crowd-source answer]"

### **"I'm running behind on time"**
- Skip Demo #2 (keep Demo #1 - it's essential)
- Shorten Q&A at end
- Give full time to exercise (most important part!)

### **"Energy is dropping"**
- Ask a question: "Who's seen this before?"
- Share a quick personal win with AI
- Take a 2-minute "stretch break"

---

## **✅ Day 1 Success Checklist**

You'll know it went well if:
- ✅ Everyone wrote at least 2 prompts
- ✅ People asked questions (means they're engaged!)
- ✅ You saw "aha!" moments
- ✅ Prompts are being added to the shared library
- ✅ They're excited about Day 2

It's OK if:
- ❌ You stumbled on a word (totally normal)
- ❌ A demo didn't work perfectly (just iterate!)
- ❌ You didn't cover everything (priorities: recipe + demos + exercise)

---

## **🔄 After Day 1: Quick Debrief**

Take 5 minutes to jot down:
1. **What worked well?** (Do more of this tomorrow)
2. **What to adjust?** (Tweak for Day 2)
3. **Any participant questions to follow up on?**

---

## **📅 Looking Ahead**

### **Day 2 Materials (Coming Next):**
- Tool deep-dive: ChatGPT vs Claude
- Setting up workspaces/projects
- Uploading docs for context

### **Day 3 Materials:**
- Practical workflows
- Team use cases
- Time-saved tracking

---

## **💪 Final Confidence Boost**

**You're not here to be perfect. You're here to be helpful.**

Your participants need:
1. ✅ Clear instructions (you have them)
2. ✅ Practical examples (you have them)
3. ✅ Hands-on practice (you're giving them time)
4. ✅ Someone who cares (that's you!)

Everything else is secondary.

**Take a deep breath. You've prepared well. You know this material. They're rooting for you.**

**Let's make them faster and more effective. You've got this!** 🚀
