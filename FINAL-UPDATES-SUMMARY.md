### **Slide 6: What AI Is Good/Bad At (UPDATED)**

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Changed title from "What AI Can & Can't Do" to "What AI Is Good & Bad At"
- ‚úÖ Changed headers from "‚úÖ CAN" / "‚ùå CAN'T" to "‚úÖ GOOD AT" / "‚ö†Ô∏è BAD AT"

**Rationale:**

- Removed "access live data" since some tools (ChatGPT, Grok) CAN do this
- "Knowing your context" is more relevant limitation

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Changed last bullet from "Ask: When unsure, check with team/IT" 
- ‚úÖ To: "Double-Check: Review all information for accuracy before using or sharing"
