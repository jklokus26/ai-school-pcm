# Day 1 Practice Facilitation Script (Slide 12)

## Opening (10–15 seconds)
- "Your turn! Write two prompts you’ll actually use this week. Add them to the Prompt Library with your name, team, and use case."

## Instructions (short and clear)
- "Use the 6-part recipe. At minimum, include Task + Format."
- "Examples on the slide: summarize meeting + next steps; draft first-pass brief; turn outline into email; extract key points from doc."

## Coaching Moves (walk the room)
- Ask: "What are you working on this week?"
- Suggest: "Add a tone and a word count."
- Suggest: "Specify output format: bullets, table columns, or email."
- Encourage: "If it’s too generic, give one short example."

## Time Checks
- Minute 2: "If you’re stuck, start with a tedious task you do weekly."
- Minute 4: "Run your prompt once. Make one refinement."

## Capture
- "Add your best prompt to the library before you finish."

## Transitions
- If short on time: "We’ll keep perfecting these tomorrow—save your prompt and we’ll iterate more."
