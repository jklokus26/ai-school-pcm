**Purpose:** Set expectations
**Time:** 30 seconds

---

### **Slide 2: Smart Intern (ENHANCED - Interactive)**

**What Changed:**
- Added **Quick Poll** box (yellow highlight)

- Two-part engagement: great results vs. terrible results
- Bottom insight: "The difference? How you asked."

**Why It Works:**
- Immediate audience participation
- Everyone relates to the experience
- Sets up the value of learning prompting
- Creates psychological buy-in

**How to Present (2 minutes):**
> "Think of AI as a smart intern. [Read traits]. Quick poll‚Äîraise your hand if you've tried ChatGPT or Claude and got a great result? [pause]. Now raise your hand if you got a terrible result? [pause, laugh]. What's the difference? How you asked. Today you'll learn to get great results every time."

---

### **Slide 3: What AI Can/Can't Do (ENHANCED - Concrete Examples)**

**What Changed:**
- Made examples SPECIFIC: "Draft newsletters in 2 min" vs. generic "Draft content"
- Made limitations SPECIFIC: "Can't verify facts or stats" vs. "not perfect"
- Added **"Think"** prompt box at bottom
- Interactive element: "What's ONE task that eats 30+ minutes of your day?"

**Why It Works:**
- Specific examples are memorable
- Time savings quantified (2 minutes!)
- Thinking prompt gets them mentally applying AI to their work
- Promise of immediate value ("We'll show you in 10 minutes")

**How to Present (2 minutes):**
> "What can AI do? [Read left side, emphasize time savings]. What can't it do? [Read right side]. Now think: what's one task that eats 30+ minutes of your day? [pause 5 seconds]. Good. We'll show you how to AI-ify it in 10 minutes."

**Why It Works:**
- Shows the evolution of a prompt
- Makes iteration concrete and non-threatening
- Time frame: "under 2 minutes" makes it doable
- Visual progression with color coding

**How to Present (2 minutes):**
> "Here's how pros work: Write, get output, refine, retry. Most people give up at Try 1. Watch this: [read example]. Try 1 is too vague. Try 2 is better but generic. Try 3? Perfect. That takes pros under 2 minutes. Today you'll learn to do this."
