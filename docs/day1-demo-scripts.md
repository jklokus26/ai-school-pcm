# Day 1 Demo Scripts

Keep demos simple. Use the slide prompts and highlight the recipe parts.

## Demo #1 — Messy Notes → Clear Email (Slide 11)

1. Say: "Let me show you how I turn messy notes into a clear email."
2. Paste messy notes (from your meeting or use a generic short note set).
3. Prompt (use recipe parts explicitly):
   "You are an executive assistant helping prepare for weekly team meetings.\n\nReview this memo/notes and provide:\n1. TL;DR (3 bullets, 50 words max)\n2. Open questions that need answers\n3. Next steps with suggested owners\n\nUse professional tone. Be concise and actionable."
4. Run. Then highlight:
   - Summary is concise
   - Action items are structured
   - You could iterate: "Make it more casual" or "Add subject line"
5. Ask the room: "Where would YOU use this this week?"

## Demo #2 — Extract Action Items (Slide 11)

1. Say: "Same idea—extract action items with owners and deadlines."
2. Paste short text with tasks and names (or reuse output from Demo #1).
3. Prompt:
   "Extract action items from the text. Output as a table with columns: Owner | Task | Deadline. If a deadline is missing, write 'TBD'."
4. Run. Then highlight:
   - It finds tasks and assigns owners
   - Easy to paste into a tracker
5. If short on time: skip this demo and move to the exercise

## Backup Plan (If Tool Is Slow)
- Show `day-1/demo-screenshots.html` and narrate the same points
- Or paste the prepared prompts and say what you expect as output
