# Day 1 Q&A Guidance (Stay Within Slides)

Use only what’s on slides and presenter notes.

## Safe Answers

- Job impact: "AI is a smart intern—handles tedious tasks so you focus on strategy and judgment."
- Trusting outputs: "Always fact-check. You’re the editor; AI is the writer."
- Bad prompts: "Normal. Iterate: add specifics, format, or an example."
- Confidential data: "Don’t paste unless approved. When in doubt, redact or ask IT."
- Tool choice: "Tomorrow’s topic. Quick version: ChatGPT for general tasks & images; Claude for longer docs/writing/analysis."

## Hallucinations (Slide 15)
- "AI can confidently make things up. It’s trained to always answer and doesn’t know when it doesn’t know."
- Mitigations: web search, allow "I don’t know" (if trained), and you verify critical info.

## Redirects (Out of Scope Today)
- "We’ll cover tool setup and projects tomorrow. Today is prompting basics and practice."

## Encourage Sharing
- "What’s one prompt you’ll try this week?"
- "Where could this save you 30 minutes?"
