# Day 1 Slide-by-Slide Presenter Script

Use this as speaker notes. Keep language simple. Do not add content not on slides.

## Slide 1 — Title
Say this:
- "Welcome! Today is practical and hands-on. Clear instructions in, great results out."

Transition:
- "Let’s set the stage."

## Slide 2 — The Reality About AI
Say this:
- "AI is everywhere and moving fast. Today’s goal: get comfortable using it thoughtfully and effectively."

Engage:
- "What’s one thing you’re curious about AI?"

## Slide 3 — Smart Intern Analogy
Say this:
- "Think of AI as a smart intern—fast, tireless, follows instructions. But: needs clear directions and it’s not a source of truth."

Engage (quick poll):
- "Who’s tried ChatGPT or Claude and got a great result? A terrible one? The difference is usually how you asked."

## Slide 4 — What’s an LLM? (Autocomplete + Tokens)
Say this:
- "LLM is the engine behind the tools. The simple truth: ChatGPT is sophisticated autocomplete—it predicts the next word based on patterns."
- "It reads in chunks called tokens—like ‘Hello world’ equals two tokens—which is why it’s great at meaning but can struggle with spelling or counting."

## Slide 5 — The Big 3 Tools
Say this:
- "We’ll focus on ChatGPT and Claude. Each has strengths; pick the right tool for the job."

## Slide 6 — Capabilities Comparison
Say this:
- "Different tools shine in different areas. Use ChatGPT for everyday and images; Claude for writing and coding."

## Slide 7 — AI Beyond Text
Say this:
- "AI can also work with audio, images/video, and code. Today we focus on text."

## Slide 8 — Good & Bad At
Say this:
- "Great for drafting, reformatting, extracting, brainstorming, and outlines. Not great at perfect facts, nuance, secrets, or knowing your context."

Bridge:
- "That’s why we give it context and constraints."

## Slide 9 — The Prompting Recipe
Say this:
- "Use six parts: Role, Context, Task, Constraints, Format, Examples."
- "At minimum, Task + Format gives 80% of the value."

Point at example:
- Briefly name each part on the slide.

## Slide 10 — Iteration Loop
Say this:
- "Pros iterate quickly: write prompt → get output → refine. Aim to reach ‘Try 3’ fast."

## Slide 11 — Demo Time
Say this:
- "Demo 1: messy notes to clear email. Demo 2: extract action items with owners."

Prompt to audience:
- "As you watch, think: where would you use this?"

## Slide 12 — Your Turn
Facilitate:
- "Write two prompts you’ll use daily. Add them to the Prompt Library with your name, team, and use case."

Coaching tips:
- "Add constraints (tone, length, format). Ask for a table if needed."

## Slide 13 — Meta-Learning
Say this:
- "Use AI to improve your prompting: ask it to analyze your task, fix vague prompts, show options, and save what works."

## Slide 14 — Common Mistakes
Say this:
- "Too vague, no constraints, missing format, giving up too soon. Fix by being specific and iterating."

## Slide 15 — Guardrails (Hallucinations)
Say this:
- "AI can confidently make things up. It’s trained to always answer and doesn’t know when it doesn’t know."
- "Mitigations: use web search, allow ‘I don’t know,’ and you verify critical info."
- "Privacy: don’t paste confidential data unless approved."

## Slide 16 — Quick Wins
Say this:
- "Quick wins today: emails, document summaries, meeting action items, creative ideas."

## Slide 17 — Q&A & Discussion
Facilitate:
- "Questions or ideas? Share a prompt you plan to try."

## Slide 18 — Final Takeaway
Say this:
- "Remember: Be specific. Iterate. Verify. AI is your smart intern."

## Slide 19 — Resources
Say this:
- "Prompt Library, AI Playbook, recording, and links to OpenAI/Claude guides."
