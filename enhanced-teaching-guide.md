## **🆕 NEW SLIDE #1: The Iteration Loop (Slide 5)**

### **What It Teaches:**
- Prompting is a conversation, not a one-shot command
- First attempt is rarely perfect—that's normal!
- The 3-step cycle: Write → Get Output → Refine

### **How to Present (2 minutes):**

**Your Script:**
> "Here's the most important thing to understand about prompting: **it's iterative**. You're not expected to write the perfect prompt on the first try.
>
> Think of it as a conversation. You write a prompt, get output, then refine. Maybe the tone is wrong—tell AI to adjust it. Too long? Ask for shorter. That's the loop.
>
> The best AI users iterate 2-3 times per prompt. Don't give up after one try!"

**Interactive Element:**
- Ask: "Quick show of hands—who's given up on AI because the first output wasn't perfect?"
- Validate: "That's totally normal. Now you know: iteration is the skill!"

**Key Insight to Emphasize:**
Point to the red box at the bottom: **"Prompting is a conversation, not a command."**

## **🆕 NEW SLIDE #2: Meta-Learning (Slide 8)**

### **What It Teaches:**
- You can ask AI to help you write better prompts
- AI can debug your prompts, suggest improvements, and teach you
- The best AI users leverage AI to get better at AI

### **How to Present (3 minutes):**

**Your Script:**
> "Now here's a power move that most people miss: **Use AI to learn AI.**
>
> Stuck on writing a prompt? Ask AI to help you! Say: 'Write a prompt that helps me summarize meetings.' 
>
> Got a prompt that's not working? Ask: 'Why isn't this working? [paste your prompt and the bad output].'
>
> This is meta-learning—using the tool to get better at the tool. It sounds obvious, but almost nobody does it!"

**Interactive Element:**
- Ask: "Who's thought of asking AI for help with prompts?"
- Point out: "You're learning a skill AI can teach you. Use that advantage!"

**Real Example to Share:**
> "Last week I had a prompt that wasn't working. I pasted it into ChatGPT and asked, 'Make this more specific.' It gave me 3 improvements in 10 seconds. Game changer."

**Key Insight to Emphasize:**
Point to the yellow box: **"The best AI users use AI to get better at AI!"**

## **🆕 NEW SLIDE #3: Common Mistakes & Quick Fixes (Slide 9)**

### **What It Teaches:**
- 4 most common mistakes beginners make
- Specific before/after examples
- Quick fixes that immediately improve results

### **How to Present (3 minutes):**

**Your Script:**
> "Let's talk about the mistakes I see every day. These are easy to fix once you know them.
>
> **Mistake #1: Too vague.** 'Summarize this' gives you generic output. Instead: 'Summarize in 3 bullets, focus on action items.' See the difference?
>
> **Mistake #2: No constraints.** 'Write an email' could be 10 words or 1,000. Add: '100-word professional email.'
>
> **Mistake #3: Missing format.** If you don't tell AI how to format output, it guesses. Want a table? Say 'Create a table with 2 columns.'
>
> **Mistake #4: Giving up too soon.** The first output isn't working? Don't quit. Say: 'Make it shorter' or 'Use bullet points instead.' That's iteration!"

**Interactive Element:**
- Point to each quadrant as you explain
- Ask: "Which of these have you done?" (Most hands will go up—normalize it!)

**Key Insight to Emphasize:**
> "These aren't failures—they're learning moments. Now you know the fix!"

---

## **🆕 NEW SLIDE #4: Quick Wins (Slide 11)**

### **What It Teaches:**
- 4 categories of immediate time-saving tasks
- Specific examples for each category
- Realistic time savings per task

### **How to Present (2 minutes):**

**Your Script:**
> "Let's talk about where you'll see results immediately. These are quick wins you can use today.
>
> **Email tasks:** Draft responses, tighten long emails, change tone. Save 5-10 minutes per email.
>
> **Document work:** Summarize long docs, extract key points, create outlines. Save 15-20 minutes per doc.
>
> **Meeting tasks:** Action items, summaries, follow-ups. Save 10-15 minutes per meeting.
>
> **Creative tasks:** Brainstorm ideas, generate titles, draft first versions. Save 20-30 minutes per task.
>
> Pick ONE of these today and try it. That's your homework."

**Interactive Element:**
- Ask: "Which category is most relevant to your work?" (People can shout out or raise hands)
- Encourage: "That's where you start!"

**Key Insight to Emphasize:**
Point to the time savings: **"This isn't theoretical—these are real minutes back in your day."**

---

## **🆕 NEW SLIDE #5: Final Takeaway (Slide 13)**

### **What It Teaches:**
- Memorable closing that reinforces core concepts
- Simple 3-word framework: Be Specific, Iterate, Verify
- Visual recap of the "Smart Intern" analogy

### **How to Present (2 minutes):**

**Your Script:**
> "Before we wrap, here's what you need to remember:
>
> **AI = Smart Intern.** That's the mental model. Clear instructions → Great results.
>
> Three things: **Be Specific.** Don't be vague—add details, constraints, format.
>
> **Iterate.** First try won't be perfect. Refine and retry.
>
> **Verify.** AI is fast but not infallible. You're the editor.
>
> That's it. Those three things will make you 10x better at AI than most people."

**Interactive Element:**
- Point to each icon as you explain
- Ask: "Which one do you think you'll struggle with most?" (Most will say "iterate"—validate that!)

**Key Insight to Emphasize:**
Point to the gradient box: **"This is your north star. Come back to this when you're stuck."**

## **💡 Enhanced Interactive Elements Throughout**

### **Slide 2 (Smart Intern) - NEW Question:**
**New addition:** "Would you tell an intern 'do the thing'?"
- **How to use:** Pause after showing slide, let them think
- **Follow-up:** "Exactly! You'd give context, specifics, examples. Same with AI."

### **Slide 7 (Your Turn) - NEW Challenge:**
**New addition:** "Use the 6-part recipe for at least one prompt!"
- **How to use:** Point to this during exercise time
- **Walk around and check:** "Did you use the recipe?" (Encourage those who did!)

### **Slide 12 (Homework) - NEW Task:**
**New addition:** "Try the 'meta-learning' trick once"
- **How to use:** Explain this is their stretch goal
- **Example:** "Ask AI: 'Improve this prompt: [your prompt]'"

## **🎯 Teaching Strategy: What Makes These Slides Effective**

### **1. The Iteration Loop (Slide 5)**
**Why it's valuable:**
- Removes the pressure of "perfect first try"
- Normalizes experimentation
- Shows AI as conversational, not transactional

**Research backing:** Carol Dweck's Growth Mindset research shows that normalizing iteration reduces anxiety and improves learning outcomes.

### **2. Meta-Learning (Slide 8)**
**Why it's valuable:**
- Dramatically reduces learning curve
- Empowers self-directed learning
- Creates "aha!" moment for most participants

**Research backing:** Metacognition (thinking about thinking) is one of the highest-impact teaching strategies per John Hattie's research (effect size: 0.69).

### **3. Common Mistakes (Slide 9)**
**Why it's valuable:**
- Addresses real problems participants will face
- Provides immediate solutions
- Before/after examples show clear path forward

**Research backing:** Error analysis and corrective feedback are proven high-impact teaching methods (Hattie effect size: 0.62).

### **4. Quick Wins (Slide 11)**
**Why it's valuable:**
- Concrete, actionable examples
- Quantified time savings create urgency
- Helps participants choose their first use case

**Research backing:** Simon Sinek's "Start With Why" principle—people adopt new tools when they see clear, personal benefits.

### **5. Final Takeaway (Slide 13)**
**Why it's valuable:**
- Simple, memorable framework (3 words)
- Visual reinforcement of core concept
- Strong closing that sticks

**Research backing:** The "Rule of Three" in cognitive psychology—people remember triads better than lists of any other length.

---

## **🚀 How to Make It Even More Engaging**

### **Add Verbal Polls:**
Throughout the presentation, ask quick questions:
- "Who's used ChatGPT before?" (Slide 1)
- "Who's tried AI and been frustrated?" (Slide 5)
- "Who knew you could ask AI for help with prompts?" (Slide 8)
- "Which mistake have you made?" (Slide 9)
- "Which quick win is most relevant to you?" (Slide 11)

**Why this works:** Raises hands = physical engagement = better retention

### **Use the "Think-Pair-Share" Technique:**
During exercise time (Slide 7):
1. **Think:** 2 min - Everyone writes their first prompt silently
2. **Pair:** 3 min - Turn to neighbor, share prompts, give feedback
3. **Share:** 2 min - Volunteers share best prompts with group

**Why this works:** Peer teaching is high-impact (Hattie effect size: 0.55)

### **Add a "Lightning Round":**
At the end of Slide 9 (Common Mistakes):
- "Shout out one mistake you'll avoid!" 
- Let 3-4 people call out answers
- Affirm each one: "Exactly!"

**Why this works:** Public commitment increases follow-through
