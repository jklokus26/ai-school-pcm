## **üéØ HOW TO PRESENT THE NEW SLIDES**

### **Slide 3: What's an LLM? (2 minutes)**

**Script:**
> "Before we dive into prompting, quick foundation: What's an LLM? Large Language Model. Think of it like this: The LLM is the engine. ChatGPT and Claude are the cars with steering wheels and dashboards.
>
> Simple version: The LLM learned patterns from billions of text examples. When you prompt it, it predicts what text should come next based on those patterns. That's it!
>
> Why does this matter? Different engines are good at different things. Same as cars. Let me show you."

---

### **Slide 4: The Big 3 (3 minutes)**

**Script:**
> "Three main tools you'll encounter: [Point to blue] ChatGPT by OpenAI. Their newest is GPT-4o‚Äîfast and powerful. You've probably used this.
>
> [Point to yellow] Claude by Anthropic. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is their best. Especially strong at coding and long documents.
>
> [Point to green] Grok by xAI, Elon Musk's company. Unique thing? It has real-time access to X, formerly Twitter. Great if you need current social data.
>
> For this course, we'll focus on ChatGPT and Claude‚Äîthey're what most teams use daily."

---

### **Slide 5: Which Model for What? (3 minutes)**

**Script:**
> "So which do you use? Here's the cheat sheet.
>
> [Point to left] ChatGPT strengths: Image generation with DALL-E built right in. Web browsing for current info. Voice mode if you want to talk to it. Plugins and custom GPTs. Great all-purpose tool.
>
> [Point to left bottom] Claude strengths: Coding and technical work‚Äîit's really good at this. Can handle super long documents, like 200-page reports. Strong at analysis and reasoning. High-quality writing with nuanced tone. Follows complex instructions really well.
>
> [Point to right] Quick decision guide: Use ChatGPT if you need images created, current web info, or voice. Use Claude if you need code written, long docs analyzed, complex reasoning, or high-quality writing. Use Grok if you need real-time X data.
>
> [Point to bottom] Pro tip: Try the same prompt in both ChatGPT and Claude. Pick what works best for YOUR specific task. They're different tools for different jobs."

## **üí° KEY TEACHING POINTS**

### **For Slide 3 (LLM):**
- Keep it simple: "Pattern prediction"
- Car/Engine analogy is memorable
- Don't go deep into technical details
- Sets up next slide perfectly

### **For Slide 4 (The Big 3):**
- Visual recognition: icons + colors
- Quick overview, not deep dive
- Focus on "you'll use ChatGPT & Claude"
- Acknowledge Grok but don't emphasize

### **For Slide 5 (Which Model):**
- This is the practical slide
- Give clear decision criteria
- Emphasize: "Try both, pick what works"
- Real examples help (image generation, code review, etc.)

---

## **üé§ INTERACTIVE MOMENT**

### **After Slide 5, Ask:**
> "Quick show of hands: Who's used ChatGPT before? [pause] Who's tried Claude? [pause] Okay, by the end of today you'll know exactly when to use each one."

**This:**
- Checks baseline knowledge
- Creates engagement
- Validates the content relevance

---

## **üìà WHY THESE SLIDES MATTER**

### **Before Adding These Slides:**
- ‚ùå Jumped straight to prompting without foundation
- ‚ùå People confused about "models" vs. "tools"
- ‚ùå No guidance on which tool to use when
- ‚ùå Session was ~35 minutes (too short)

### **After Adding These Slides:**
- ‚úÖ Clear foundation: LLM = brain, ChatGPT/Claude = interface
- ‚úÖ People know the landscape (3 main options)
- ‚úÖ Clear decision framework for tool selection
- ‚úÖ Session is 55-58 minutes (perfect for 45-60 minute slot with Q&A)

## **üéØ COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

**Q: "Should I use ChatGPT or Claude?"**
**A:** "For coding and long documents, Claude. For images and web info, ChatGPT. For everything else, try both and see what you prefer!"

**Q: "What's the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-4o?"**
**A:** "GPT-4o is newer and faster. Both are powerful. For most daily work, GPT-4o is great."

**Q: "Do I need to pay for these?"**
**A:** "Both have free tiers. Paid versions give you access to the newest models and more usage. Your company might have accounts."

**Q: "What about other tools like Gemini?"**
**A:** "Google's Gemini is good too! These three are the most common in enterprise settings. Same prompting principles apply to all of them."

## **‚ú® DESIGN PRINCIPLES MAINTAINED**

**Simple Language:**
- "Engine vs. car" not "neural architecture"
- "Pattern prediction" not "statistical modeling"
- "Good at different things" not "specialized capabilities"

**Visual Learning:**
- Color-coded boxes (blue/yellow/green)
- Icons for each tool (ü§ñüß†‚ö°)
- Side-by-side comparison layout

**Minimal Words:**
- Bullet points, not paragraphs
- Short model names with context
- Quick decision guide format

**Action-Focused:**
- "Try both, pick what works"
- "Use ChatGPT if..." (clear criteria)
- Decision framework, not theory
