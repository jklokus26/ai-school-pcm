# Day 2: Recording Script

**Read this directly during your recording. Natural, conversational tone.**

## Opening (Before Slide 1)
Welcome back—Day 2.
Yesterday was prompting basics.
Today we go deeper into tools, workspaces,
and practical workflows you’ll actually use. [pause]

## Slide 1 — Title
Welcome to Day 2.
Core tools, workspaces, and practical workflows.
This is the hands‑on day. [pause]

## Slide 2 — Quick Recap: Day 1
Day 1 was: AI = smart intern, the prompting recipe,
and fast iteration.
Today, we put those skills to work
with real tools and real projects. [pause]

## Slide 3 — Today's Focus
Plan for today:
compare Claude vs ChatGPT,
set up workspaces,
handle files,
and use voice input. [pause]

## Slide 4 — Claude vs ChatGPT: At a Glance
Key takeaway:
ChatGPT is great for everyday tasks and images.
Claude excels at long documents and deep analysis.
Claude’s larger context window helps with big docs. [pause]

## Slide 5 — Projects & Knowledge Spaces
Projects give you persistent context.
Upload files once—AI remembers them across chats.

Two memories:
long‑term (fuzzy, can be wrong)
and working memory (what you provide now—reliable).

Paste important info directly—
don’t rely on training memory.
Projects keep your docs in working memory. [pause]

## Slide 6 — When to Use Projects/Workspaces
Create a project when you have multiple docs,
recurring tasks, need consistent context,
or a specific brand voice.

Skip it for one‑off tasks,
simple questions,
changing context,
or sensitive work.

Rule of thumb: if you’ll reuse the same context 3+ times,
create a project. [pause]

## Slide 7 — Live Demo: PDF → TL;DR
Task: upload a PDF memo and get:
TL;DR, open questions, and next steps.
Watch the prompt—notice how it references the uploaded doc. [pause]

---

## Slide 8 — Prompt Refinements: Before & After
Before: vague.
After: role, format, constraints, tone.

What changed?
We added specifics—and the quality jumps. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 9 — Adding Voice & Format Constraints
Voice can be: professional, casual,
technical‑but‑accessible, or “match this example.”

Format can be: bullets, tables, email, or JSON.
They work even better when combined. [pause]

## Slide 10 — File Types & How to Handle Them
PDFs: both tools handle them; Claude is better for 50+ pages.
Images: both can analyze; ChatGPT can also generate.
Spreadsheets: Claude handles them better.
Audio/video: get a transcript first, then upload. [pause]

## Slide 11 — Real-World Use Cases by Role
Here are role‑specific workflows.
As we go, pick one or two that apply to your job
and plan to try them. [pause]

---

## Slide 12 — The LLM Council
Pro move: ask the same prompt in ChatGPT and Claude.
Compare, then pick the best parts.
Use this for important decisions,
creative brainstorming, and complex analysis.
Travel planning is a great example. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 13 — Voice Input: Work 50% Faster
Don’t type—talk.
On mobile, tap the mic.
On desktop, use Super Whisper or MacWhisper.

Always verify the transcription—
especially numbers and technical terms.
Example: nutrition label → transcribe → verify → analyze. [pause]

## Slide 14 — Tips for Better Results
Five tips:
upload docs early,
be specific about format,
ask for drafts,
chain prompts,
and save what works.

Iteration is normal—the first prompt is rarely perfect. [pause]

## Slide 15 — Live Demo: Create Your First Project
Complete workflow:
create a project,
add docs,
write custom instructions,
test with a real task,
iterate to improve. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 16 — Q&A
Common questions:
“Should I create a project for everything?” → No—only for recurring context.
“Can I share projects?” → Not directly—share the instructions.

Think about your first project.
What doc or context do you use repeatedly?
Save your best prompts somewhere you’ll find them. [pause]

[switch slide]

## Slide 17 — Remember This
Pick the right tool: ChatGPT for quick tasks,
Claude for deep work.

Three principles:
Use Projects. Iterate. Save what works.
Try creating a project this week—you’ll save time. [pause]
