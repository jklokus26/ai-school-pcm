## Slide-by-Slide Guide

### Slide 1: Title (1 min)
**Welcome participants back**
- "Great to see you all again! Today we're going hands-on with the tools."
- Quick tech check: "Can everyone see the screen clearly?"

---

### Slide 2: Quick Recap (2 min)
**Interactive recall**
- Ask: "Who can remind us: what was the 6-part prompting recipe?" (accept any answer)
- Emphasize: "Today you'll see these concepts in action with real tools"

**Key callout:**
- "Remember: AI = Smart Intern. We're giving that intern better tools today."

---

### Slide 3: Today's Focus (2 min)
**Set expectations**
- "We're comparing ChatGPT and Claude—not to pick a 'winner,' but to help you choose the right tool for YOUR work"
- Preview: "You'll leave with a working project/workspace by the end"

**Timing note:** Keep this slide brief—audience is ready for hands-on

---

### Slide 4: Claude vs ChatGPT Comparison Table (3-4 min)
**Key talking points:**
- **Long documents:** "Claude can handle 200K+ tokens—like a 500-page book in one chat"
- **Image generation:** "Only ChatGPT has DALL-E built-in"
- **Voice chat:** "ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode is conversational; Claude is text-only"

**Interactive moment:**
- Ask: "Raise your hand if you mainly work with: PDFs/docs? Emails? Creative content?"
- Direct them: "If docs → try Claude first. If images/voice → ChatGPT"

**Caveat to mention:**
- "These features change fast. As of Oct 2025, this is current. Always check what's new!"

---

### Slide 5: Projects & Knowledge Spaces (5 min)
**Critical concept: Working Memory vs Long-Term Memory**

**Analogy explanation:**
- "Remember the 'zip file' from Day 1? That's long-term memory—vague and fuzzy"
- "Working memory is THIS CHAT, right now. Super clear and reliable"
- "Projects keep your important docs in working memory permanently"

**Real example:**
- "Without project: You paste your style guide every single time (tedious)"
- "With project: Upload once, AI remembers it forever for this project"

**When to show:**
- Pull up ChatGPT → show "Explore GPTs" button
- Pull up Claude → show "Projects" sidebar
- Don't create yet—just show where they live

---

### Slide 6: When to Use Projects (3 min)
**Decision framework:**
- "Ask yourself: Will I use this context 3+ times? → Create a project"
- "One-off task? → Just use regular chat"

**Examples to emphasize:**
- ✅ Brand voice guide for all marketing copy
- ✅ Q4 analysis with same 5 reports
- ❌ Random question about caffeine in coffee
- ❌ Directions to a restaurant

---

### Slide 7: Live Demo - PDF → TL;DR (8-10 min)
**THIS IS THE MAIN DEMO - Take your time!**

**Setup (30 seconds):**
1. Open Claude in new tab
2. Have PDF ready to upload
3. Show the prompt on screen so they can copy later

**Demo steps:**
1. **Upload PDF:** Drag & drop into Claude
2. **Paste prompt:** Use the exact prompt from slide
3. **Submit and wait:** Narrate what's happening: "Claude is reading the entire document..."
4. **Show output:** Read through TL;DR bullets, open questions, next steps
5. **Compare (if time):** Upload same PDF to ChatGPT, use same prompt, show difference

**What to narrate:**
- "Notice how it organized everything exactly as I asked—that's the power of format constraints"
- "The open questions are things the document didn't answer—super helpful for follow-ups"
- "I didn't read this 12-page memo. AI did it in 30 seconds"

**Common issues & fixes:**
- PDF doesn't upload: "Sometimes files are too large—try compressing or use text extraction first"
- Output too generic: Live iterate: "Make the TL;DR more specific to financial implications"

**Video note:** If showing pre-recorded video instead, pause after and ask: "Questions about what you just saw?"

---

### Slide 8: Exercise - Create Your Workspace (10-12 min)
**Transition:** "Now YOU do this. I'll walk you through step-by-step."

**Live facilitation:**
1. **Step 1 (1 min):** "Pick ChatGPT or Claude. If you work with lots of docs, try Claude. If you need images/voice, try ChatGPT"
   
2. **Step 2 (2 min):** "Create new project:"
   - **ChatGPT:** Click "Explore GPTs" → "Create a GPT" → Name it
   - **Claude:** Click "Projects" → "New Project" → Name it

3. **Step 3 (3 min):** "Upload 1 document you use often—style guide, template, anything"
   - Walk around (if in-person) or monitor chat (if virtual) for stuck participants

4. **Step 4 (3 min):** "Add your prompts from Day 1 as custom instructions"
   - Show example: "You are a [role] helping with [task]. Always format as [format]."

5. **Step 5 (3 min):** "Test it! Paste some real content and see what happens"

**Support:** Have demo-screenshots.html ready to share for those who need visual reference

---

### Slide 9: Prompt Refinements Before/After (4 min)
**Show the contrast dramatically:**
- "BEFORE is what most people do"
- "AFTER is what gets results"

**Key change to emphasize:**
- "Added: role, specific format, constraints, tone"
- "Result: 10x better output quality"

**Interactive:** Ask someone to read the "After" prompt aloud—reinforces structure

---

### Slide 10: Voice & Format Constraints (3 min)
**Practical examples:**
- Voice: "Don't say 'professional'—show an example sentence"
- Format: "Don't say 'organize'—say 'table with columns X, Y, Z'"

**Quick drill:**
- Ask: "How would you constrain tone for a newsletter to investors?" (wait for answers)
- Accept: professional, data-driven, cautious, forward-looking, etc.

---

### Slide 11: File Types & Handling (3 min)
**Quick reference slide—don't linger**
- "Different files, different tools. Here's the cheat sheet."

**One key point:**
- "For audio/video: Get transcript FIRST (Otter.ai, Descript), THEN upload to AI"

---

### Slide 12: Real-World Use Cases by Role (3 min)
**Make it personal:**
- Ask: "Raise your hand if you're in: content/production? Analysis? Ops? Comms?"
- Point to relevant column: "This section is for you!"

**Encourage specificity:**
- "These aren't the only use cases—think about YOUR daily tasks"

---

### Slide 13: The LLM Council (3 min)
**Powerful technique:**
- "I do this for important decisions: ask ChatGPT AND Claude, compare results"
- "Takes 2 minutes. Gives you 2 perspectives."

**When to use:**
- "Not for everything! Save it for decisions that matter"

**Live micro-demo (if time):**
- Type a question in both tools, show different answers side-by-side

---

### Slide 14: Voice Input & Verification (4 min)
**Stats that surprise:**
- "50% of desktop queries via voice. 80% on mobile. Why? It's way faster."

**Tools to recommend:**
- Mobile: Built-in (just tap mic)
- Desktop: Super Whisper ($30 one-time) or MacWhisper

**Critical verification point:**
- "Always check transcription accuracy BEFORE asking AI to analyze"
- "AI can misread: 1,000 vs 1000 vs 1.000 vs 10.00"

---

### Slide 15: Tips for Better Results (2 min)
**Rapid-fire reminders:**
- Read each bullet
- Emphasize: "Chain prompts—build on previous output instead of starting over"

---

### Slide 16: Workspace Setup Demo (Show video or skip if already demoed live)
**If showing video:** Introduce, play, pause for questions

**If skipping:** "You already created yours in the exercise—great work!"

---

### Slide 17-18: Q&A (5-8 min)
**Facilitate discussion:**
- "What worked in your exercise?"
- "What got stuck?"
- "Share your workspace name and what it does!"

**Capture wins:** Add successful prompts to shared Prompt Library in real-time

---

### Slide 19: Wrap Up & Next Session (2 min)
**Key takeaways:**
- "Pick the right tool for the job"
- "Use projects for recurring tasks"
- "Iterate—don't give up after first try"

**Homework (optional):**
- "Use your workspace 3 times this week"
- "Add successful prompts to the library"

**Preview Day 3:**
- "Next: Advanced workflows, multi-step tasks, and when to use thinking models"

---

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Do I need to pay for Pro/Plus?"**
- A: "For learning, free is fine. For daily professional use, Pro tiers ($20-200/mo) give you the best models and features. Most teams find $20/mo ChatGPT Plus worth it."

**Q: "Which tool is better?"**
- A: "Depends on your task! Long docs/analysis → Claude. Quick tasks/images/voice → ChatGPT. Try both and see what you prefer."

**Q: "Can I use this for confidential data?"**
- A: "Check your company policy first. ChatGPT Enterprise and Claude for Work have privacy guarantees. Free/Plus tiers may use data for training."

**Q: "What if AI gives wrong information?"**
- A: "Always verify! Add to your prompt: 'Double-check facts and cite sources.' Use search tools for recent info."

**Q: "How do I know which model I'm using?"**
- A: "Check top of chat window. ChatGPT shows 'GPT-5' or 'GPT-5 mini'. Claude shows 'Claude Sonnet 4.5' etc. Always use the best model available to you."

## Troubleshooting

**Participant can't create project:**
- Guide to demo-screenshots.html for step-by-step screenshots
- Pair them with another participant
- Offer to show on your screen

**PDF upload fails:**
- File too large: "Try a shorter doc or copy-paste text instead"
- Wrong format: "PDFs work best. Word docs need conversion"

**Prompt gives bad results:**
- Live iterate: "Let's fix this together. What's missing? Format? Constraints?"
- Show the iteration loop in action

**Out of time:**
- Skip Slides 11-12 (file types, use cases) if needed
- Prioritize: Demo (Slide 7) + Exercise (Slide 8) + Q&A
