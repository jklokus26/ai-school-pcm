## **🎤 Your Opening Script**

> "Hey everyone! Thanks for joining. Quick show of hands—who's used ChatGPT or Claude before? [Pause for hands] 
>
> Great! Today's going to be super practical. No jargon, no theory—just stuff you can use tomorrow.
>
> Here's the core idea: Think of AI like a **smart intern**. Really fast, never sleeps, will do tedious work all day. But—and this is key—it needs **clear instructions**. 
>
> You wouldn't tell an intern 'write something about our project.' You'd say 'Draft a 150-word email to investors, friendly tone, include these three updates, end with next steps.'
>
> That's exactly how AI works. And today, you're learning that prompting recipe. Let's jump in."

## **🔑 Key Phrases to Use (Repeat Often)**

- "Think of it like a smart intern..."
- "AI is a draft assistant, not a decision maker"
- "Always fact-check the output"
- "First prompt rarely perfect—iterate!"
- "You're the editor; AI is the writer"

---

## **📋 Demo Checklist**

### Before Each Demo:
- [ ] "Let me show you a real example..."
- [ ] Show messy input first
- [ ] Show your prompt (point out recipe parts)
- [ ] Run it live (or show prepared screenshot if glitchy)
- [ ] Highlight 2-3 things about the output
- [ ] Ask: "Where could YOU use this?"

### Demo #1 (Notes → Email):
✅ **Point Out:** Structure, tone, next steps, speed  
✅ **Teaching moment:** "I could refine this further by saying 'make it more casual' or 'add a subject line'"

### Demo #2 (Extract Actions):
✅ **Point Out:** Found all tasks, pulled out owners/deadlines, ready to paste into tracker  
✅ **Teaching moment:** "Same prompt works for any text with action items"

---

## **✏️ During Exercise Time (38-52 min)**

### Your Job:
- Walk around (if in-person) or scan tiles (if virtual)
- Ask individuals: "What are you working on?"
- Offer quick tips: "Try adding a word count" or "Specify the output format"
- Celebrate wins: "That's perfect—add it to the library!"

### Common Issues You'll See:
| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Prompt too vague | "Add constraints: tone, length, format" |
| Output too long | "Tell AI: 'Keep under 100 words'" |
| Output too generic | "Add an example or be more specific about audience" |
| Not sure what to write | "What's one tedious task you do weekly?" |

## **💬 Handling Questions**

### **"Will AI replace my job?"**
**Your answer:** "Think of it like Excel. Did spreadsheets replace accountants? No—they made them faster. AI handles tedious parts so you focus on strategy, relationships, creativity—the stuff only humans can do."

### **"Can I trust the output?"**
**Your answer:** "Treat AI like that smart intern: Always fact-check. It's excellent for drafts, structure, brainstorming. But you're the editor. You bring the judgment."

### **"My prompt didn't work."**
**Your answer:** "Totally normal! Prompting is iterative. First draft rarely perfect. Add more specifics, give an example, or change constraints. You'll get the hang of it fast."

### **"Can I use this with confidential info?"**
**Your answer:** "Good catch. General rule: don't paste sensitive data unless your company has an enterprise plan with privacy controls. When in doubt, redact names/numbers or ask IT."

### **"Which tool should I use—ChatGPT or Claude?"**
**Your answer:** "We'll cover that tomorrow! Quick version: ChatGPT for general stuff, Claude for longer docs and team workflows. Both work great for today's exercises."

### **"What if I don't know what to prompt?"**
**Your answer:** "Start with any tedious task: summarizing, drafting, extracting info. Use our recipe: role, task, constraints, format. Test it. Refine. That's it!"

## **⚠️ Guardrails (52-60 min)**

Rapid-fire these bullets:

✅ **Privacy:** No confidential data (unless approved)  
✅ **Verify:** Always fact-check outputs  
✅ **Iterate:** Refine prompts based on results  
✅ **Document:** Save good prompts to library  
✅ **Ask:** When unsure, check with team/IT

Say: "These aren't rules to scare you—they're habits to make you effective and safe."

## **🎬 Your Closing (Last 2 Minutes)**

> "Quick recap: AI is your smart intern. Use the 6-part recipe. Iterate until it's right. Always edit the output.
>
> **Your homework:** Test your 2 prompts on real work. Refine them. Note 1-2 questions for tomorrow.
>
> **Tomorrow:** We dive into tools—setting up workspaces, adding docs, refining prompts further.
>
> Questions? Slack me anytime. Great work today—see you tomorrow!"

## **🧘 Quick Confidence Resets (Use Anytime)**

**If you lose your place:**
- Take a breath. Glance at your slide. Say: "So where were we... [continue]"

**If demo breaks:**
- Smile. Say: "Perfect example of why we fact-check AI! Let me pull up my backup."

**If someone asks something you don't know:**
- "Great question—let me test that and follow up after the session."

**If energy drops:**
- Ask a question: "Who's tried something like this before?"
- Share a quick win: "I used AI last week to summarize a 10-page doc in 30 seconds. Saved me an hour."

**If you're nervous:**
- Remember: They WANT you to succeed
- You know this material
- You've used AI successfully
- You're helping them get faster
- **You've got this!**
