Welcome, everyone. I'm Joe. Today we're covering everything you need to know about AI in one session. This entire curriculum was created with AI. I'm not an engineer—I'm just someone who figured out how to work with these tools effectively, and hopefully you will too.

What you'll get today: In about 30 minutes, you'll master the essential skills that matter. We're covering three areas: mastering prompting, picking the right tools, and building workflows that save hours of work.

Reality check: AI is everywhere and moving faster than almost any technology we've seen. It's not going away. Today we'll understand what AI actually is, why it's improving so rapidly, and how to use it effectively. The goal is to get comfortable using AI before it becomes part of everything we do.

Think of AI as a smart intern. It's fast and tireless, great at tedious tasks, and follows instructions well. But it needs clear directions and it's not a source of truth. Most people have tried ChatGPT or Claude and gotten mixed results—sometimes great, sometimes terrible. The difference is how you ask. Today you'll learn to get great results every time.

What is an LLM? It stands for Large Language Model—the engine that powers AI tools. Think of it like cars: the LLM is the engine, and models like GPT-5 or Sonnet 4.5 are different car brands. AI is basically smart autocomplete. It predicts the next word based on patterns from billions of text examples. AI reads in chunks called tokens—'Hello world' equals 2 tokens. That's why AI struggles with spelling and counting but excels at understanding meaning. Different models are good at different things.

Think of AI like a zip file. It has fuzzy memory from training, but can search the web for current info. Long-term memory is like remembering a book you read last year—fuzzy and sometimes wrong. Working memory is what you just told it in this chat—clear and reliable. Pro tip: upload docs directly to chat. For current info, click 'Search web' or AI may give outdated data.

The big three tools: ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. ChatGPT has GPT-5 as the main model, plus mini and nano versions. Claude has Sonnet 4.5 as the latest and Opus 4.1 as the most capable. Grok has Grok 4 with real-time X and Twitter data. We'll focus on ChatGPT and Claude—they're what most teams use daily.

The prompting recipe that works every time: You need six components: role (you are a...), context (what you're working on), task (the job to do), constraints (tone, length, audience), format (bullets, table, etc.), and examples (optional). Real example: You are an executive assistant. Summarize these meeting notes and identify action items. Keep summary under 150 words, professional tone. Output as summary with 3 bullets, then action items table with owner, task, and deadline columns. At minimum, always include task and format—that's 80% of the value.

The secret: use AI to get better at AI. Ask AI to teach you prompting, create prompt structures for you, and design workflows. Add 'double-check all facts' to prompts for verification. Follow the demo screenshots for copy-paste materials to practice these techniques.

How pros work: the iteration loop. Write prompt, get output, refine and retry. Example: try one, 'write a newsletter'—too vague. Try two, 'write 400 words about Bitcoin'—better but generic. Try three, 'write 400-word newsletter about Bitcoin rally for crypto investors, professional tone, include 3 key drivers plus 1 risk'—perfect. Key insight: prompting is a conversation. Most people stop at try one. Pros get to try three in under 2 minutes.

Pro technique: break big tasks into small steps. Example: podcast to multi-format content. Prompt one: summarize this podcast transcript in 5 key points. Prompt two: take point 3 and expand it into a 300-word blog post. Prompt three: turn that blog post into 5 tweet variations. Prompt four: create an email newsletter intro using the summary from prompt one. Key insight: each prompt builds on the last. AI keeps context from earlier in the chat. This is way more powerful than one giant prompt.

One great output becomes a reusable template forever. Reverse-engineering technique: paste the great result and ask AI to give you the exact prompt that would produce this format every time. AI reverse-engineers the perfect prompt for you. Save templates in: personal notes, Custom GPTs, Claude Projects, or a notes doc. Keep iterating: test template 3 times, refine what doesn't work, add examples, and share with team for feedback.

Remember: by default, AI is just a zip file—no internet, no calculator. When to add tools: Web search for recent info, current events, and fact-checking. Use ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, or Grok. Code interpreter for math, data analysis, charts, and spreadsheets. Use ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis. Thinking models for complex reasoning, hard math, and multi-step logic. Use o4-mini or DeepSeek R1. Decision tree: start simple. If wrong or outdated, add tools. If still wrong, try thinking model.

Real workflow for comparing quarterly reports. Step one: create Claude Project called 'Q4 Analysis.' Step two: upload all 5 quarterly reports. Step three: ask to compare revenue growth across all quarters, which had highest growth, what drove it. Step four: create a table summarizing key metrics across all reports. Step five: turn this into an executive summary email. Why this works: all docs are in working memory, AI can cross-reference, no manual comparison needed. Watch out for: verify numbers are accurate, check for missing context, AI might miss nuances, always spot-check critical data.

Privacy tip: Free and Plus tiers may use your chats for training unless you opt out. Safe to share: public info, your own writing, general questions, and practice materials. Don't share: customer data, financials, proprietary strategies, or passwords. Enterprise versions don't train on your data—ask your IT team if available.

Reality check: the decade of agents. Watch Andrej Karpathy explain why it's the decade of agents, not the year. What AI can do today: draft emails and documents, summarize and extract data, answer questions with verification, help you code with supervision, generate images and basic content. What's still missing: continual learning between sessions, true multimodal understanding, full computer use like clicking and navigating, human-level judgment in complex scenarios, reliable execution without errors. What this means: AI is a powerful assistant today. It's not replacing your job—it's making you faster. Use it wisely, verify outputs, and keep learning.

What to use when: ChatGPT for quick questions and everyday tasks. Claude for writing and coding. Grok if you need real-time Twitter data.
