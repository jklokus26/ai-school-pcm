## **⚡ INTERACTIVE QUESTIONS TO ASK**

### **Slide 2 (Smart Intern):**
> "Would you tell an intern 'do the thing'? No! You'd give context, specifics, examples."

### **Slide 5 (Iteration Loop):**
> "Quick show of hands—who's given up on AI because the first output wasn't perfect?"

### **Slide 8 (Meta-Learning):**
> "Who's thought of asking AI for help with prompts?" (Most won't—that's the aha moment!)

### **Slide 9 (Common Mistakes):**
> "Which of these have you done?" (Normalize mistakes!)

###**Slide 11 (Quick Wins):**
> "Which category is most relevant to your work?" (Get them thinking about first use case)

### **Slide 13 (Final Takeaway):**
> "Which one will you struggle with most?" (Most say "iterate"—validate that!)

### **On Common Mistakes (Slide 9):**
✅ "Too vague → Add specifics"

### **On Quick Wins (Slide 11):**
✅ "Email tasks: Save 5-10 min each"  
✅ "Document work: Save 15-20 min each"
