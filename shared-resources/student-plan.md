## **AI School – Week 1 (101)**

Everyone learns the basics, sets up their workspace, and leaves with a small set of repeatable prompts/workflows they will use in daily work. At the end of the sprint, a successful outcome looks like:

* Each person has a personal prompt sheet (3–5 prompts).  
* Each team has 1–2 documented workflows in a shared playbook.

### **Schedule**

***Time Slots:** Wed–Fri (this week), 10–11am or 2–3pm ET*

#### Day 1 — AI fundamentals \+ Prompting Basics (45–60m)

* What AI can/can’t do (smart intern analogy), privacy basics, and guardrails.  
* Prompt structure: role → context → task → constraints → format → examples.  
* Demo: messy notes → clear email; extract bullet action items.  
* Exercise: everyone writes 2 prompts and starts the shared Prompt Library.

**Takeaways:** Personal cheat-sheet; shared library created.

#### Day 2 — Core tools: Claude & ChatGPT (45–60m)

* Overview of key tools: ChatGPT (general use) vs Claude (team workflows).  
* Setup: create a workspace/project; add 1–2 reference docs.  
* Demo: upload a doc → “TL;DR \+ open questions \+ next steps.”  
* Exercise: build one reusable “summarize \+ next steps” prompt.

**Takeaways:** Each person has an active workspace and starter prompts.

#### Day 3 — Practical Workflows (45–60m)

* Cross-team use cases: content drafting, research, meeting notes, and outlines.  
* Demos tied to our work: sponsor brief, show-notes draft, diligence checklist.  
* Exercise: each person picks one workflow, executes it end-to-end, and logs time saved.

**Takeaways:** One completed quick win per person; data logged in tracker.

#### Team Automation Sessions (Week 2\)

* Each team meets separately the following week to design and test 1–2 workflows.  
* Joe coordinates and leads each session with pre-built automation ideas tailored to that team.  
* Teams decide on shared vs. individual workflows and identify their AI lead for ongoing use.  
* Collaborative setups can be built in Claude (shared projects) or individually in ChatGPT.

**Takeaways:** 1–2 finalized team workflows documented in the AI Playbook; each team designates an AI lead responsible for adoption and maintenance.

### **Tools & Accounts**

* **ChatGPT:** all users can start with free accounts; upgrade to Pro tier if needed for advanced features.  
* **Claude:** ideal for shared team workflows and projects.  
* Each team designates one person to manage AI access and collaboration.
