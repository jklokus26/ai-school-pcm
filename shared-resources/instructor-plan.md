## **Slack Message**

*AI School (101) next week — Tuesday–Thursday, 10–11am or 2–3pm ET*

*We’re running a few short AI sessions this week — Tuesday to Thursday, 10–11am or 2–3pm ET. Quick crash course to help everyone get faster with AI. Bring a laptop and a doc you use often.*

---

## **Overview**

Teaching tone: fast, practical, zero jargon. Use the “smart intern” analogy throughout.  
 Materials to prep (before Tuesday):

* Google Drive \> AI School: (1) Prompt Library (doc), (2) AI Playbook (doc)  
* 2–3 safe sample docs (press release, memo, meeting notes).  
* Tool access: ensure everyone has ChatGPT and/or Claude accounts.  
* Slidelet: 5 slides max (agenda, prompting recipe, examples, guardrails, links).

## **Day 1 — Fundamentals \+ Prompting Basics (45–60m)**

### **Minute-by-minute**

* **0–5:** Why care? AI as a smart intern: fast, tireless, needs clear instructions.  
* **5–12:** What it can/can’t do: draft, transform, extract, plan; not a source of truth.  
* **12–20:** Prompt recipe (write on screen):  
  * Role (“You are a \[producer/analyst/editor\]…”)  
  * Context (what you’re working on)  
  * Task (the job)  
  * Constraints (tone, length, audience, policy)  
  * Format (bullets, table, JSON)  
  * Examples (1–2 short exemplars)  
* **20–30:** Live demo \#1 (notes → email). Prompt: “You are a communications assistant. Using the notes below, draft a concise email in my tone. Keep it under 120 words. End with 2 actionable next steps. Notes:”  
* **30–38:** Live demo \#2 (extract action items \+ owners from a paragraph).  
* **38–52:** Exercise: everyone writes two prompts they’ll use daily (“Summarize a meeting \+ next steps”; “Draft a first-pass brief/outreach”). Add them to Prompt Library (name \+ team).  
* **52–60:** Review \+ guardrails: no sensitive data; sanity-check outputs; iterate.

**Homework:** personalize your two prompts; try them once.

## **Day 2 — Core Tools: Claude & ChatGPT (45–60m)**

**Teaching note:** keep tool talk pragmatic — when to use which — not feature-dump.

### **Agenda**

* **0–8:** Claude vs ChatGPT at a glance: handling long docs, coding help, images, file types.  
* **8–18:** Projects/knowledge spaces (persistent context with key docs).  
* **18–28:** Live demo: upload a PDF memo → “TL;DR \+ open questions \+ next steps.”  
* **28–40:** Exercise: each person creates a workspace/project and adds 1 reference doc \+ their two Day 1 prompts.  
* **40–52:** Prompt refinements: add voice/format constraints; show before/after.  
* **52–60:** Q\&A; capture best prompts to library.

**Homework:** run one real task through your workspace; log minutes saved.

## **Day 3 — Practical Workflows (45–60m)**

### **Agenda**

* **0–10:** Menu of quick wins (pick 2 relevant to your team):  
  * Content: outline → draft → tighten to 150 words; title & 3 hooks  
  * Research: “summarize \+ gaps \+ sources to check”  
  * Meetings: notes → action items by owner/deadline  
  * Planning: turn goals into a 5-step checklist \+ risks  
* **10–20:** Demo: sponsor brief from a one-pager; ask follow-ups; produce final brief.  
* **20–40:** Hands-on: each person completes 1 quick win end-to-end; paste result \+ time saved in tracker.  
* **40–55:** Share & improve: 2 volunteers show prompts; group suggests tweaks.  
* **55–60:** Save final prompts to library (tag by use case).

**Homework:** repeat your quick win once; bring any blockers.

## **Week 2 — Team Automation Sessions**

**Objective:** turn common team tasks into reusable templates/workflows.

### **Agenda (per team)**

* **0–8:** Identify key team task (examples):  
  * Producer: show-notes \+ clip list from transcript  
  * Analyst: diligence checklist from source docs  
  * Ops: meeting notes → owner-tagged task list  
* **8–15:** Design the workflow (fill this one-pager in AI Playbook):  
  * Task name \+ owner  
  * Inputs (files/links)  
  * Prompt/template (final version)  
  * Output format \+ “definition of done”  
  * Where it’s stored  
* **15–35:** Build & test in pairs (swap each other’s inputs; does it work?).  
  **35–50:** Refine & finalize; save to Playbook; add link to Prompt Library.  
* **50–60:** Decide adoption plan (who uses it, when, how we measure).

**Homework:** run your workflow once in real work; note issues.

## **Artifacts to Leave Behind**

* Prompt Library (company-wide)  
* AI Playbook (team workflows)  
* Usage/Time-Saved Tracker (sheet)  
* “AI Wins” Slack thread pinned

## **Role-Based Starter Prompts**

**Producer / Content**

* “You are a content producer. Turn the outline below into a 200-word draft in voice. Include a headline and 3 alt titles. Keep sentences short. Outline:”  
* “Given this transcript, list 5 clip moments with start times and a 1-sentence hook. Output a table with columns: time, hook, notes.”

**Analyst / ProCap**

* “You are an investment analyst. From the memo below, produce a TL;DR, 5 diligence questions, and a risk list. Output in bullets under those three headings. Memo:”

**Ops / Meetings**

* “You are an operations assistant. Convert these meeting notes into action items grouped by owner, each with a due date and one next step. Notes:”

**Prompt quality checklist:** Role, context, task, constraints, format, example, iterate.

## **Guardrails**

* Don’t paste confidential data unless approved. Redact sensitive parts.  
  Treat outputs as drafts; verify facts.  
* Keep prompts and playbook in shared folder; name clearly.
