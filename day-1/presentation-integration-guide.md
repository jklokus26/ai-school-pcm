## **üîÑ BETTER INTEGRATION IDEAS**

### **Idea 1: Pre-Load Demo Tabs**

**Before your session:**
1. Open ChatGPT/Claude
2. Pre-paste the messy notes (don't send yet)
3. Pre-paste the prompt (don't send yet)
4. When demo time comes, just hit "Send"

**Benefit:** No copy-pasting during presentation = smoother flow

### **Idea 2: Show Expected Outputs**

**Add to your slides:**
- Screenshot the expected AI outputs
- Show them on slides as "What you'll see"
- Then do live demo to confirm

**Benefit:** Participants know what to expect, less anxiety

### **Idea 3: Interactive Polling**

**During exercise time:**
- Ask: "Who's written their first prompt?"
- Ask: "Who's added it to the library?"
- Share screen of someone's good example

**Benefit:** Keeps everyone engaged, builds community

### **If internet cuts out:**

## **üí° PRO TIPS FOR SMOOTH INTEGRATION**

### **Tab Management:**
- Arrange tabs in order: Slides, ChatGPT, Library, Demos
- Use `Cmd+1`, `Cmd+2`, etc. to switch quickly
- Close everything else to avoid distractions

### **Screen Sharing:**
- Share only your browser window (not entire screen)
- You can see presenter notes on your laptop
- Audience sees only the shared browser

### **Energy Management:**
- Demo time is your "performance" - bring energy
- Exercise time is their time - step back and facilitate
