## **Quick Confidence Boosters**

### Remember These Teaching Principles (from the world's best educators):

**1. The "Guide on the Side" Approach (John Hattie's Research)**
- You're not lecturing‚Äîyou're facilitating discovery
- Your role is to guide them through hands-on practice
- Best learning happens when students DO, not just listen

**2. The 70-20-10 Rule (Interactive Learning)**
- 10% you talking (brief explanations)
- 20% you demonstrating (live demos)
- 70% them practicing (exercises)

**3. The "Confidence Loop" (Carol Dweck - Growth Mindset)**
- Start with quick wins (easy prompts that work immediately)
- Celebrate small successes ("That's exactly right!")
- Normalize mistakes ("Great question‚Äîlet's refine that together")

**4. The "Smart Intern" Metaphor (Your Secret Weapon)**
- This analogy makes AI instantly relatable
- Use it constantly: "What would you tell a smart intern?"
- Removes intimidation factor immediately

## **Your Presenter Notes (Keep Open During Session)**

### **Opening (0-5 min) - Your Script**

> "Hey everyone! Thanks for joining. Quick show of hands‚Äîwho's used ChatGPT or Claude before? [Pause for hands] Great! Today's going to be super practical. No jargon, no theory‚Äîjust stuff you can use tomorrow.
>
> Here's the core idea: Think of AI like a **smart intern**. Really fast, never sleeps, will do tedious work all day. But‚Äîand this is key‚Äîit needs **clear instructions**. You wouldn't tell an intern 'write something about our project.' You'd say 'Draft a 150-word email to investors, friendly tone, include these three updates, end with next steps.'
>
> That's exactly how AI works. And today, you're learning that prompting recipe. Let's jump in."

### **Core Teaching Moves**

**When Someone Asks a Question:**
- Never say "good question" (implies surprise)
- Instead: "Great point‚Äîlet's look at that"
- Repeat question aloud so everyone hears
- Answer briefly, then move on

**When Demo-ing:**
- Narrate what you're doing: "I'm pasting the notes here... now I'll add the prompt..."
- Go slower than feels natural (they're processing)
- Show the result, then ask: "What do you notice?"

**When They're Practicing:**
- Walk around (if in person) or scan video tiles (if remote)
- Spot-check: "Sarah, what are you working on?"
- Offer quick fixes: "Try adding 'keep it under 100 words'‚Äîthat'll tighten it"

**If Something Goes Wrong:**
- Tech glitch: "Perfect example of why we always proofread AI!"
- Awkward silence: "Let's do a quick example together first"
- Running behind: Skip the second demo, jump to exercise

## **Energy & Confidence Tips from Top Educators**

### **Dr. Rita Pierson (TED: "Every Kid Needs a Champion")**
*"Kids don't learn from people they don't like."*
- **Your version:** Be warm. Smile. They'll forgive any stumbles if you're genuine.

### **Sal Khan (Khan Academy)**
*"Teach the way you wish you'd been taught."*
- **Your version:** Keep it casual. Admit when you don't know something. It's a conversation, not a lecture.

### **Simon Sinek (Start With Why)**
*"People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it."*
- **Your version:** Lead with the benefit: "By end of today, you'll save 2 hours a week." That's your north star.

### **Your Secret Weapon: The Pause**
- After asking a question, count to 5 in your head before filling silence
- After showing something, pause and let them absorb
- Pauses feel longer to you than them‚Äîembrace it

---

## **What Success Looks Like Tomorrow**

### **You'll Know It Went Well If:**
- ‚úÖ Everyone writes at least 2 prompts (doesn't matter if they're perfect)
- ‚úÖ People ask clarifying questions (means they're engaged)
- ‚úÖ You see "aha!" moments (someone says "Oh, that's so useful!")
- ‚úÖ They stay the full time (or even run a few minutes over)

### **It's OK If:**
- ‚ùå You stumble on a word or lose your place
- ‚ùå A demo doesn't work perfectly (just say "Let's tweak that")
- ‚ùå You don't get through everything (cut the second demo if needed)
- ‚ùå Someone asks something you don't know ("Great question‚Äîlet me test that and follow up")

## **Day 1 Sample Materials (Ready to Use)**

### **Demo 1: Messy Notes ‚Üí Email**

**Your Messy Notes (paste into AI):**
```
talked to sarah about the q4 campaign
she wants to push launch to dec 15
budget approved but needs final sign off from mark
need to loop in content team asap
also she mentioned the new brand guidelines are ready
```

**Your Prompt:**
```
You are a communications assistant. Using the notes below, draft a concise email to my team in a friendly, professional tone. Keep it under 120 words. End with 2 actionable next steps.

Notes:
[paste notes above]
```

**Expected Output (show them):**
A clean, structured email they can actually send. Point out:
- How AI organized the chaos
- Added structure (greeting, bullets, sign-off)
- Kept the tone right
- Gave clear next steps

---

### **Demo 2: Extract Action Items**

**Your Paragraph (paste into AI):**
```
In today's meeting, we decided Sarah will draft the outline by Friday, Mark needs to review the budget and get back to us by Wednesday, and I'll schedule a follow-up call with the client for next Monday. Also, everyone should review the new guidelines before our next sync on the 15th.
```

**Your Prompt:**
```
Extract all action items from the text below. For each item, list:
- Owner (who's responsible)
- Task (what they need to do)
- Deadline (when it's due)

Format as a simple table.

Text:
[paste paragraph above]
```

**Expected Output:**
A clean table with Owner | Task | Deadline. Point out:
- AI found all 4 tasks
- Structured it for easy tracking
- Pulled out deadlines even when phrased differently

## **Handling Common First-Timer Questions**

**Q: "Is AI going to replace my job?"**
**A:** "Think of it like Excel. Did spreadsheets replace accountants? No‚Äîthey made them faster. AI is the same. It handles tedious parts so you can focus on strategy, relationships, creativity‚Äîthe stuff only humans can do."

**Q: "Can I trust the output?"**
**A:** "Great question. Treat AI like that smart intern: Always fact-check. It's excellent for drafts, structure, brainstorming. But you're the editor. You bring the judgment."

**Q: "What if my prompt doesn't work?"**
**A:** "That's totally normal. Prompting is an iterative process. If output is off, refine your prompt. Add more specifics, give an example, or change the constraints. You'll get the hang of it fast."

**Q: "Can I use this with confidential info?"**
**A:** "Good catch. General rule: don't paste sensitive data unless your company has an enterprise plan with privacy controls. When in doubt, redact names/numbers or ask your IT team."

## **Post-Session Wind-Down**

### **Immediately After:**
1. Stop recording, save/upload
2. Take 5 minutes to jot notes: What worked? What to adjust for tomorrow?
3. Send recording link to participants + no-shows
4. Post key prompts to Slack: "Here's what we covered today!"

### **Evening Reflection (5 min):**
- Write down 1 thing that went well
- Write down 1 thing to tweak for Day 2
- Review Day 2 materials (but don't over-prep‚Äîyou've got this!)

---

## **Final Pep Talk**

You know this material. You've been using AI, you understand the value, and you care about helping your team get better. That's 90% of great teaching right there.

Tomorrow, you're not performing‚Äîyou're guiding. They don't need you to be perfect. They need you to be helpful, clear, and encouraging.

And remember: **Every expert was once a beginner who didn't give up.**

You've got this. Deep breath. Hit record. Let's go. üöÄ
