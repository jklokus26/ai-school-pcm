## Opening (Before Slide 1)
Hey everyone, I'm Joe.

Today we're diving into practical AI.

Quick note: this curriculum was created with help from AI.
I'm not an engineer—I just learned to work with these tools.

AI is here, moving fast, and not going away.
So let's get good at it together. That's what today is about. [pause]

## Slide 1 — Title
Welcome! Today is hands-on.
You'll learn how to give AI clear instructions
and get consistently better results. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 2 — The Reality About AI
AI is everywhere and moving fast.
Our goal is simple: get you comfortable using it in daily work.
You might be thinking, “How do I actually use this?”
That’s exactly what we’ll cover today. [pause]

## Slide 3 — Smart Intern Analogy
Think of AI as a smart intern:
fast, tireless, follows instructions well.

But it needs clear directions,
and it’s not a source of truth.

Maybe you’ve tried ChatGPT or Claude.
Great result? Terrible result?
The difference was how you asked. [pause]

## Slide 4 — What's an LLM?
LLM means Large Language Model—the engine behind these tools.
At heart, it’s sophisticated autocomplete:
it predicts the next word.

It reads in chunks called “tokens,”
which is why it’s great at meaning
but not perfect at spelling or counting letters. [pause]

## Slide 5 — The Zip File Mental Model
Think of AI’s training memory like a zip file—
a fuzzy, compressed copy of the internet from months ago.

Two memories:
long‑term (vague, can be wrong)
and working memory (what you put in this chat—clear and reliable).

Tip: upload your docs directly.
For current info, explicitly use web search. [pause]

## Slide 6 — The Big 3 Tools
We’ll focus on ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok.
Each has strengths—pick the right tool for the job.
As of Oct 2025: GPT‑5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Grok 4. [pause]

## Slide 7 — Capabilities Comparison
Quick takeaway:
ChatGPT is best for everyday tasks and images.
Claude excels at writing and coding.
Use the right tool for the outcome you want. [pause]

## Slide 8 — AI Beyond Text
AI does more than text—audio, images, video, code.
Today, we’ll focus on text,
since that’s what most people use day to day. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 9 — Good & Bad At
Great at: drafting, reformatting, extracting data,
brainstorming, and creating outlines.

Not great at: perfect facts, replacing judgment,
understanding nuance, keeping secrets,
or knowing your specific context.

That’s why we add context and constraints. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 10 — The Prompting Recipe
There are six parts to a strong prompt:
role, context, task, constraints, format, examples.

If you only remember two:
task and format get you most of the way there. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 11 — The Secret: Use AI to Get Better at AI
Ask AI to teach you prompting.
You can say: “Help me write a better prompt for this task.”
It will guide you and even build templates for you.
You don’t need to memorize the recipe. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 12 — Iteration Loop
Pros iterate fast.
Try 1, then Try 2, then Try 3.
The first prompt is rarely perfect.
Small tweaks lead to big improvements. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 13 — Demo Time
Let’s see it in action.
First, step‑by‑step setup for a ChatGPT Project.
Then, we’ll create a reusable prompt template.
As you watch, think where you’d use this. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 14 — Common Mistakes
Four common mistakes:
too vague, no constraints, missing format,
and giving up too soon.

Fix: be specific, add limits, specify the output,
and keep iterating. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 15 — Guardrails
AI will confidently make things up.
It’s trained to always answer.

Mitigations: use web search,
allow “I don’t know,” and verify critical details.
And don’t paste confidential data unless it’s approved. [pause]

## Slide 16 — Quick Wins
Easy wins for today: emails, document summaries,
meeting action items, creative brainstorming.

Pick one you’ll try this week. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 17 — Q&A & Discussion
Common questions:
“Which tool should I start with?” → ChatGPT is the most versatile.
“How do I know if my prompt is good enough?” → If you’re at ~80%, it’s working.

Think of one prompt you’ll try this week. [pause]

[switch slide]

---

## Slide 18 — Final Takeaway
AI = Smart Intern.
Clear instructions → great results.
Three principles: Be specific. Iterate. Verify. [pause]

## Slide 19 — Resources
Links to OpenAI and Claude guides are in the description.
Save your successful prompts somewhere you’ll find them—
Notes, a doc, whatever works for you. [pause]

## Closing
That’s Day 1.
You now have the basics to prompt effectively.
See you in Day 2—tools and workspaces next. [pause]
