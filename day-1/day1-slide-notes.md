**Format:** What to SAY and DO for each slide. Scan quickly while presenting.

---

## Slide 1 — Title
**SAY:** "Welcome! Today is practical. You'll learn how to give AI clear instructions and get great results."

**DO:** Smile, make eye contact, set friendly tone.

---

## Slide 2 — The Reality About AI
**SAY:** "AI is everywhere and moving fast. Our goal today: get comfortable using it effectively."

**ASK:** "What's one thing you're curious about AI?"

**DO:** Let 1-2 people respond briefly.

---

## Slide 3 — Smart Intern Analogy
**SAY:** "Think of AI as a smart intern—fast, tireless, follows instructions well. But it needs clear directions and isn't a source of truth."

**POLL:** "Who's tried ChatGPT or Claude? Raise your hand if you got a GREAT result... Now a TERRIBLE result?"

**SAY:** "The difference? How you asked."

---

## Slide 4 — What's an LLM?
**SAY:** "LLM = the engine behind these tools. Simple truth: it's sophisticated autocomplete that predicts the next word."

**SAY:** "It reads in chunks called 'tokens.' That's why it's great at meaning but struggles with spelling or counting letters."

---

## Slide 5 — The Zip File Mental Model
**SAY:** "AI has fuzzy memory from training—like a compressed copy of the internet from 6 months ago."

**SAY:** "Two types of memory: long-term (vague, can be wrong) and working memory (clear, reliable)."

**KEY TIP:** "Upload docs directly. For current info, explicitly use web search or AI gives outdated data."

**DO:** Point to video placeholder if time allows.

---

## Slide 6 — The Big 3 Tools
**SAY:** "We'll focus on ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. Each has strengths—pick the right tool for the job."

**SAY:** "Current models as of October 2025: GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4."

---

## Slide 7 — Capabilities Comparison
**SAY:** "Quick comparison—don't memorize this, just know: ChatGPT is best for everyday tasks and images; Claude excels at writing and coding."

**DO:** Scan table briefly, highlight stars.

---

## Slide 8 — AI Beyond Text
**SAY:** "AI does more than text—audio, images, video, code. But today we focus on text since that's what most of you'll use daily."

---

## Slide 9 — Good & Bad At
**SAY:** "AI is GREAT at: drafting, reformatting, extracting data, brainstorming, outlines."

**SAY:** "AI is BAD at: perfect facts, replacing your judgment, understanding nuance, keeping secrets, knowing your specific context."

**BRIDGE:** "That's why we give it context and constraints."

---

## Slide 10 — The Prompting Recipe
**SAY:** "Six parts to a good prompt. Look at the example on the right—it's color-coded."

**SAY:** "Minimum for 80% value: Task + Format."

**DO:** Point to each colored section briefly.

---

## Slide 11 — The Secret: Use AI to Get Better at AI
**SAY:** "Most valuable skill: Ask AI to teach you prompting!"

**SAY:** "Notice the 'Create Your Prompt' example—AI builds templates for you."

**KEY MESSAGE:** "Real talk: Don't memorize the recipe. Just ask AI: 'Help me write a better prompt for [your task].'"

**DO:** Read one demo box example aloud.

---

## Slide 12 — Iteration Loop
**SAY:** "Pros iterate fast: Try 1 → Try 2 → Try 3. First prompt is rarely perfect."

**SAY:** "Example shows going from vague to specific to perfect in 3 tries."

---

## Slide 13 — Demo Time
**SAY:** "Demo 1: Turn messy notes into a clear email. Demo 2: Extract action items with owners."

**ASK:** "As you watch, think: where would YOU use this?"

**DO:** Open demo-screenshots.html and run live demos.

---

## Slide 14 — Common Mistakes
**SAY:** "Four big mistakes: too vague, no constraints, missing format, giving up too soon."

**SAY:** "Fix: Be specific. Add limits. Specify output. Keep iterating."

**DO:** Scan through the before/after examples.

---

## Slide 15 — Guardrails
**SAY:** "AI WILL make things up confidently. It's trained to always answer—doesn't know when it doesn't know."

**SAY:** "Mitigations: use web search, tell it to say 'I don't know,' and YOU verify critical info."

**SAY:** "Privacy: Don't paste confidential data unless your company approves."

---

## Slide 16 — Quick Wins
**SAY:** "Easy wins you can use today: emails, document summaries, meeting action items, creative brainstorming."

---

## Slide 17 — Q&A & Discussion
**SAY:** "Your turn! Questions? Ideas? Share a prompt you plan to try."

**DO:** Let conversation flow. Answer questions. Encourage sharing.

---

## Slide 18 — Final Takeaway
**SAY:** "Remember this: AI = Smart Intern. Clear instructions → great results."

**SAY:** "Three principles: Be Specific. Iterate. Verify."

---

## Slide 19 — Resources
**SAY:** "Recording will be available. Links to OpenAI and Claude guides are here."

**SAY:** "Save your successful prompts somewhere convenient for reuse."

**CLOSE:** "Questions? Ask your team lead!"
